# 🏆 Elite Page - Rankers Only Configuration

## ✅ What Changed:

### Backend `/get-teams` Endpoint Updated

**File:** `backend/src/index.ts` (Lines 270-305)

### **Before:**
- Returned ALL teams (including those who didn't finish)
- Teams without Q15 completion were pushed to the bottom

### **After:**
- ✅ **Only returns teams that completed Question 15**
- ✅ Sorted by completion time (fastest first)
- ✅ Includes rank number (1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Includes `solved_at` timestamp

## 📊 API Response Format:

```json
[
  {
    "rank": 1,
    "team_name": "Team Alpha",
    "solved_at": "2025-10-30T10:05:30.123Z",
    "users": [
      { "EnrollNo": "001" },
      { "EnrollNo": "002" },
      { "EnrollNo": "003" },
      { "EnrollNo": "004" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "rank": 2,
    "team_name": "Team Beta",
    "solved_at": "2025-10-30T10:07:15.456Z",
    "users": [...]
  },
  ...
]
```

## 🎯 Ranking Logic:

1. ✅ **Filter:** Only teams with `is_completed = true` for Question 15
2. ✅ **Sort:** By `solved_at` timestamp (earliest = Rank 1)
3. ✅ **Rank:** Auto-assigned (index + 1)
4. ❌ **Exclude:** Teams that haven't completed Q15 won't appear

---

## 🔒 Guarantees:

- ✅ **Elite page shows ONLY finishers**
- ✅ **No incomplete teams displayed**
- ✅ **Rank order is accurate and fair**
- ✅ **Millisecond precision for tie-breaks**

---

## 🚀 To Apply Changes:

**Restart the backend server:**

```powershell
cd backend
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

Then the elite page will automatically show only rankers!

## 📝 Elite Page Display:

The frontend (`elites.tsx`) already:
- ✅ Fetches from `/get-teams`
- ✅ Displays rank numbers
- ✅ Shows team names and members
- ✅ Auto-refreshes data

No frontend changes needed! 🎉
