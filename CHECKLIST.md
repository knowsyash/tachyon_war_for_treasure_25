## Ready to Deploy

Your application is **100% ready** for AWS EC2 deployment!

### What You Have:
1. âœ… Production-optimized Docker containers
2. âœ… Automated deployment scripts
3. âœ… CI/CD pipeline configured
4. âœ… Health monitoring enabled
5. âœ… Complete documentation
6. âœ… Bug fixes implemented

### To Deploy on AWS:

**Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)**
```bash
# On your EC2 instance:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsyash/tachyon_war_for_treasure_25/main/setup-ec2.sh | bash
```

**Option 2: Manual Deploy**
```bash
# On your EC2 instance:
git clone https://github.com/knowsyash/tachyon_war_for_treasure_25.git
cd tachyon_war_for_treasure_25
# Configure .env files
docker-compose up -d --build
```

---

## What Happens on Deployment:

1. Docker installs automatically
2. Repository clones from GitHub
3. You provide DATABASE_URL and EC2 IP
4. Backend container builds (includes Prisma, TypeScript)
5. Frontend container builds (Next.js optimized)
6. Both services start with health checks
7. Application accessible at `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3001`

---

## Post-Deployment:

### Access URLs:
- Frontend: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3001`
- Backend API: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3002`
- Health Check: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3002/health`

### Useful Commands:
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Update app
./deploy.sh

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

---

## Current Status: âœ… READY TO DEPLOY

Your treasure hunt application is production-ready and tested. All you need is an AWS EC2 instance to run it on.

**Estimated Setup Time:** 15 minutes
**Monthly Cost:** ~$35 (EC2 t3.medium + data transfer)
